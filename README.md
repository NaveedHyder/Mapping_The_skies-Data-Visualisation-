# Mapping The skies - Data Visualisation Approach to analyse the daily and direct flight routes of Indigo airlines.
The objective of this visualization is to provide insights into the daily flight routes of IndiGo airlines between the top 25 busiest airports in India. By analyzing this data, we aim to identify which routes are most frequently served by IndiGo airlines and which airports are most frequently used as departure and destination points. Additionally, we seek to understand the distribution of IndiGo's flight routes across different regions of India and identify any patterns or trends that may emerge from the data. This information can be useful for IndiGo airlines in optimizing their flight schedules and improving their overall efficiency and profitability. It can also help travellers in planning their journeys and selecting the most convenient and cost-effective routes.
